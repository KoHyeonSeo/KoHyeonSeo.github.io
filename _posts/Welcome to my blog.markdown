Hi, I'm Hyeonseo!
First, I am happy to meet you who visited my blog.

I'm Hyeonseo Ko in South Korea.
I want to be a person who changes this world with computing technology.
I'm studying Unity, Algorithm, Metaverse - XR / VR / AR

Stay tuned!

Thank you:)

end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
